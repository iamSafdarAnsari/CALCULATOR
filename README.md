HTML Structure:
The HTML provides the foundation for the calculator's layout. The document begins with a 
<!DOCTYPE html> declaration, ensuring proper rendering across different browsers. The html element specifies the language as English, and the head section includes meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, ensuring responsiveness on various devices.

The title element names the page "Calculator," while a linked external stylesheet (style.css) handles the visual styling. Inside the body, a container div encapsulates the content, including a main heading (h1) titled "Online Calculator" and a subheading (h2) crediting Safdar Ansari as the developer.

Calculator Form:
The form named form1 is central to the calculator's functionality. It contains an input field with the id="display", where the calculation results are shown. This field is set to readonly, meaning users cannot manually type in it; instead, it's dynamically updated through button interactions.

Buttons:
The calculator includes various buttons representing numbers, operators, and functional commands like clearing the display or backspacing. Each button is created using the input element with the type="button". The buttons are categorized into:

Number Buttons: 
These buttons (0-9 and 00) input numerical values.
Operator Buttons: These buttons (/, *, -, +) input mathematical operators.
Functional Buttons: The clear (C), backspace (‚Üê), and equal (=) buttons perform special actions like resetting the display, removing the last character, or calculating the result.
CSS Styling:
The accompanying style.css file is used to style the calculator's layout and appearance. This stylesheet may include custom fonts, background colors, button styles, hover effects, and responsive design techniques to ensure the calculator looks good on all screen sizes.

Interactivity:
JavaScript (not shown in the HTML snippet but referenced through inline onclick attributes) is used to add interactivity to the buttons. For example, clicking the equal (=) button triggers the eval() function, which evaluates the expression entered by the user and displays the result.
